## Collection History

This collection has a history. I am practicing how to use **Markdown**. _This text is in Italics._ This is a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

#### Here is a list of items:

* This is the first list item.
* The second list item.
* The third.

#### And a numbered list of items:

1. The first item.  
 With a line underneath it.
2. And the second item.  
 With a line underneath it.
